Crux
====
Generic Node / Express stack used as the model 'ideal' project at [Moms Friendly Development Company](http://mfdc.biz).

The majority of this application is based on the [standard MFDC NodeJS project structure](https://github.com/MomsFriendlyDevCo/Momsronomicon/blob/master/style-node.md).


The intention of this project is **not** to provide a generator or base project but to provide a backbone underpinning all other projects. Ideally all projects should be merged with this one to pick up on new techniques or changes in the default Node setup.

The best way of doing this is to run the following in the other projects directory
